IA2013-USP
==========

Repository for control of the IA study group activities.


Goals:
  - Study and approve IA (USP 2013), of course
  - Write all code in english (varg: i think that will be cool :) )
  - Do exercises as soon as possible
  - Generate some of the pression about the course ;)

Ideas:
  - Do exercises and solve questions according to the classes
  - Make an easy programming exercise, implementing all the search algorithms (it's still an idea).

Restrictions
  - As it's likely that this code will be used to the Eps, it must be written in C++
  - If, for didactic reasons, it's necessary to use graphics interfaces, we'll use QT, making it very 
    modular (just in case we can't use QT in the EPs)
  - This is no homework to anybody, it's only reference material. If we ca't work on it,
    or something else, it's ok.

Enjoy!
